# Exercise 2: Getting started with On-Prem Kubernetes Cluster
In the provided lab environment, you would already have one Windows 10 machine running with Kubernetes Cluster already deployed and running. In this exercise, weâ€™ll connect to the VM and check the existing Kubernetes Cluster

## Task 1: Verify existing Kubernetes Cluster
In this task, you will check the existing Kubernetes cluster and verify that the cluster is up and running. 
1. Open **Windows Powershell ISE** as a administrator

2. Run the following command to check the status of the cluster.

   ```
   minikube status
   ```
   If your cluster is running, the output from minikube status should be similar to:
   
   ![](./images/azure-arc-01.png)
   
   >Note: If the status shows as **Stopped**,Run the following commands
   
   ```
   minikube delete
   ```
   
   ```
   minikube start
   ```

3. To get status of all nodes, execute below command:
  
   ```
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
   The status should show as **Ready** as shown below:

In this exercise, you explored about how to check the already onboarded Hybrid compute servers. In next exercise, you will explore more on onboarding the Azure Arc/Hybrid compute on-prem servers to Azure Arc.
